// number, boolean and string
// internally javascript have only float
// so even if we give a integer to store it'll store internally as floating point value


var x = 1, y;  // variable declaration

console.log(x);
console.log(y);

// console.log doesnot have any return value it returns special value undefined
// it'll return someting if it have any specific expression in it.
